## evolution_orf: Analyzing the evolution of ORF sequences and structures across primate and mammalian species
Scripts to extract multiple alignments of ORF sequences, reconstruct ancestral sequences, evaluate the sequence conservation of ORFs and trace similar proteins across the included species. Adjusted from https://github.com/jorruior/riboseq_orfs_analyses
